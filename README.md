Portfolio Repo
=========

This repo will consist of all the projects I want to display as my best works. This will mainly be a collection of links here in the README.

Completed this site at the MHacks hack-a-thon in Detroit along with my teammates. I was largely responsible for the front-end development for EverTexts. Go ahead and try texting the number, it actually works! So does the EverNote and email integration: http://evetexts.com/webapp/ <br />

Complete HTML and CSS project (this helped me become a finalist in the 2012 WebChallenge competition): http://mosdragon.github.io/Mountain-Lions/ <br />

HTML5 and JavaScript pong game: http://mosdragon.github.io/pong/ <br/>

Java Swing GUI made for a mockup startup my teammates and I created at HackATL at Emory, November 2013. The README will tell you exactly how to use the program: https://github.com/mosdragon/ItFits
