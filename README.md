Portfolio Repo
=========

This repo will consist of all the projects I want to display as my best works. This will mainly be a collection of links here in the README.

Completed this site at a hack-a-thon along with my teammates. I was largely responsible for the front-end development: http://evetexts.com/webapp/ <br />

Complete HTML and CSS project (this helped me become a finalist in the 2012 WebChallenge competition): http://mosdragon.github.io/Mountain-Lions/ <br />

HTML5 and JavaScript pong game: http://mosdragon.github.io/pong/ <br/>
